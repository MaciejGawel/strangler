# Assignment

As a part of the assignment, you are required to add [Zipkin][1] to the project.

Zipkin is an Open Source project that provides mechanisms for sending,
receiving, storing, and visualizing traces. This allows operators to correlate
activity between servers and get a much clearer picture of exactly what is
happening in application services.

## Implementation instructions

- Deploy Zipkin Service
- Gather spans from all microservices (including Proxy)

As a result of this exercise, prepare a report containing detailed information
about:

- introduced changes
- system configuration
- performed tests

Prepare a *pdf* file that contains all the required details and dashboard
screenshots.
